# Machine Learning Project - Titanic Dataset

Welcome to the repository for my machine learning project completed during my international semester in Seoul. The focus of this project was to solve the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, aiming to determine the fate of individuals - those who survived and those who did not. To achieve this, we employed logistic regression models.

## Folder Structure

- **`data/` :** This folder contains all the datasets utilized for training and testing the machine learning model.

- **`doc/` :** Here, you can find our project proposal document, outlining the project's objectives, methodology, and expected results.

- **`src/` :** The scripts used in the project are stored in this folder. These include code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
